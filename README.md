Introduction
This project aims at analyzing the examination taken by students of DAYLA. I focused on analyzing key metrics such as Success rate, Percentage on trial, and grade distribution among students.

Data Overview
The dataset used in this project was entered by me. Every student were matched to their exams score. Column like "Grade" was derived from the "Score"column. The following are the columns that are contained in the dataset:
Full Name - The names of all students who took the examinations
Circle - This column represents the class where each student falls into. There are 10 circles in the dataset - Vision, Mission, Excellence, Influence, Exploit, Greatness, Success, Impact, Hope, Knowledge.
Score - This column recorded the score of all students in the examination.
Grade - This is a derived column that was formed based on the score of each student. The distribution goes thus:
90-100: Distinction
70-89: Merit
60-69: Upper credit
50-59: Lower credit
49 and below: Pass

Insights
Some very key insights derived from this analysis is
1. The success rate of students was higher than the percentage on trial.
2. Circle of greatness had the highest number of students on trial.
3. Circle of mission emerged as the circle with the highest success rate.

Recommendations:
1. I will recommend that students from the circle of greatness should buckle up if they want to be successful in their final exams.

The following are the things I learnt in this project for future work:
